abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Accurate monitoring of tropical leaf phenology, such as the leaf-on/off status, at both individual and ecosystem scales is essential for understanding and modelling tropical forest carbon and water cycles, and their sensitivity to climate change. The discrepancy between tree-crown size and pixel size (i.e., spatial resolution) across orbital sensors can affect the capability of cross-scale phenology monitoring, an aspect that remains understudied. To examine the impact of spatial resolution on tropical leaf phenology monitoring, we applied a spectral index-guided, ecologically constrained autoencoder (IG-ECAE) to automatically generate a deciduousness metric (i.e., percentage of upper canopy area that is leaf-off status within an image pixel) from simulated VIS-NIR PlanetScope data at a range of resolutions from 3 m to 30 m, as well as from VIS-NIR data of three satellite platforms with the same range of spatial resolutions (3 m PlanetScope, 10 m Sentinel-2, and 30 m Landsat-8). We compared the deciduousness metrics derived from the simulated and satellite data to corresponding measurements derived from WorldView-2 (three sites) and local phenocams (four sites) at five tropical forest sites. Our results revealed that: (1) the IG-ECAE model captured the amount of deciduousness across spatial scales, with the highest accuracy obtained from PlanetScope, followed by Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8; (2) coarser spatial resolutions led to lower accuracies in tropical deciduousness monitoring, as demonstrated by both simulated PlanetScope data across various spatial resolutions and real satellite data; and (3) while not as accurate in capturing fine-scale tropical phenological diversity as PlanetScope, Sentinel-2 provided satisfactory monitoring of deciduousness seasonality at the ecosystem level consistently across all phenocam sites, whereas Landsat-8 failed to do so. Collectively, this study provides a robust assessment for advancing cross-scale tropical leaf phenology monitoring with potential for extension to pan-tropical regions and highlights the impact of spatial resolution on such monitoring efforts.<br/></div> © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Forest fires (FF) in tropical seasonal forests impact ecosystem. Addressing FF in tropical ecosystems has become a priority to mitigate impacts on biodiversity loss and climate change. The escalating frequency and intensity of FF globally have become a mounting concern. Understanding their tendencies, patterns, and vulnerabilities is imperative for conserving ecosystems and facilitating the development of effective prevention and management strategies. This study investigates the trends, patterns, and spatiotemporal distribution of FF for the period of 2001–2022, and delineates the forest fire susceptibility zones in Odisha State, India. The study utilized: (a) MODIS imagery to examine active fire point data; (b) Kernel density tools; (c) FF risk prediction using two machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF); (d) Receiver Operating Characteristic and Area Under the Curve, along with various evaluation metrics; and (e) a total of 19 factors, including three topographical, seven climatic, four biophysical, and five anthropogenic, to create a map indicating areas vulnerable to FF. The validation results revealed that the RF model achieved a precision exceeding 94 % on the validation datasets, while the SVM model reached 89 %. The estimated forest fire susceptibility zones using RF and SVM techniques indicated that 20.14 % and 16.72 % of the area, respectively, fall under the "Very High Forest Fire" susceptibility class. Trend analysis reveals a general upward trend in forest fire occurrences (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59), with a notable increase after 2015, peaking in 2021. Notably, Angul district was identified as the most affected area, documenting the highest number of forest fire incidents over the past 22 years. Additionally, forest fire mitigation plans have been developed by drawing insights from forest fire management strategies implemented in various countries worldwide. Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers and forest management authorities to develop effective strategies for forest fire prevention and mitigation.<br/></div> © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Monitoring forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for quantifying the carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. Tropical secondary forests are significant carbon sinks that sequester large amounts of carbon dioxide. While recent studies have attempted to estimate the AGB recovery rates in tropical forests, considerable uncertainty remains in the estimation of AGB recovery of secondary forests and the spatial variability of the effects that different environmental conditions and degrees of human use may have on AGB recovery. These knowledge gaps hinder further understanding of climate change mitigation potential of secondary forests. Remote sensing products provide spatially and temporally explicit information for understanding and monitoring secondary forest dynamics. To explore the local effects of different factors on AGB of secondary forests in Brazil, we used geographically weighted regression (GWR) models that account for spatial heterogeneity in geospatial data to estimate the AGB of secondary forests in Brazil. Secondary forest areas (29142 polygons) were extracted from Brazil's forest age maps between 1984 and 2019. The AGB of these areas was derived from the Climate Change Initiative Biomass maps. The effects of selected predictors such as forest age, climatic water deficit, the cation exchange capacity of soil and surrounding tree cover were analyzed. The two most influential factors, forest age and surrounding tree cover were utilized to estimate the AGB and the recovery rates per year. Our results show the high spatial variation of different predictors’ effects on the AGB of secondary forests. Also, the GWR model (with an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.74) showed considerable improvements regarding "goodness of fit" of models compared with the Ordinary Least Squares (with an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.53). Our estimated average AGB recovery rate across all Brazil's biomes is 7.5 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> (using forest age) for the first 20 years. We presented the map of the spatial variation of AGB recovery rates in Brazil. The estimated AGB recovery rates range using forest age is 28.9 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>. Our estimated mean AGB recovery rates of different biomes are 17.7 % on average higher than IPCC default rates. Our results provide baseline information for reducing uncertainties related to carbon sink estimation of secondary forests in Brazil, hence assisting in developing sustainable forest management and ecosystem restoration strategies.<br/></div> © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Climate change is a challenge to the global community and one of the causes is the increase of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>). The major emission source of this gas into the atmosphere comes from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass burning, on the other hand, the main sink comes from biochemical processes such as photosynthesis. Thus, the observation of CO<inf>2</inf> is a key point to understanding sources and sinks. In this context, The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) and 3 (OCO-3), are a NASA dedicated mission to monitor the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO<inf>2</inf>) on a global scale. We combined the OCO-2 and OCO-3 observations to study the spatial distribution of XCO<inf>2</inf> anomalies and how some of these anomalies are related to fire occurrence in the Brazilian Biomes during 2020 and 2021 considering two different seasons, Dry and Wet. The fire occurrence was obtained from Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) that provides the data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product of active fires and thermal anomalies at Near-Real Time (MCD14DL, collection 6). The OCO-2/3 observations are affected by cloud formations in wet seasons, we observe that the dry period has more observations. The XCO<inf>2</inf> anomaly values range from ∼ 7.0 ppm to −7.0 ppm and mostly positive anomalies occur in Amazon Biome, and this ecosystem has higher average values for all periods (∼0.9 ppm), compared to the other biomes. The fire occurrence was higher in dry periods, especially in 2020 when unprecedented fire outbreaks were registered in Brazil. The most affected biomes were Pantanal, Cerrado, and Amazon. XCO<inf>2</inf> positive anomalies spatially agree with fire foci over some areas, and the correlation values between them ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 depending on the biome and season, and when considering observations with clouds the correlation is slightly higher. We point out for the first time the possibility of using OCO-2 and 3 combined, also, how positive XCO<inf>2</inf> anomalies are related to fire occurrence in different ecosystems and periods, and the role of cloud detection in this relationship.<br/></div> © 2024 COSPAR},
