	abstract = {Extensive tropical floodplain wetlands, such as the Brazilian Pantanal, are complex ecosystems composed of mosaics of permanently and seasonally flooded habitats and are increasingly threatened by land use and climate change. Spatial and interannual variability in the seasonal flood pulse is a fundamental ecological driver in these ecosystems. This study analyzes optical imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite to determine the extent and seasonal patterns of inundation over five years in the northern Pantanal, a Ramsar site renowned for its wildlife. The study site is bordered by the Cuiabá and São Lourenço rivers, each with distinct flow regimes. Inundation patterns were revealed with a combination of water indices, supervised classification of land cover, and a digital elevation model. Total extent of flooding was underestimated by the optical imagery, but open water bodies were readily delineated with the land cover classification. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Since the 1960s, large-scale deforestation in the Amazon Basin has contributed to rising global CO2 concentrations and to climate change. Recent advances in satellite observations enable estimates of gross losses of above-ground biomass (AGB) stocks due to deforestation. However, because of simultaneous regrowth, the net contribution of deforestation emissions to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations is poorly quantified. Climate change may also reduce the potential for forest regeneration in previously disturbed regions. Here, we address these points of uncertainty with a machine-learning approach that combines satellite observations of AGB with climate data across the Amazon Basin to reconstruct annual maps of potential AGB during 1993-2012, the above-ground C storage potential of the undisturbed landscape. We derive a 2.2 Pg C loss of AGB over the study period, and, for the regions where these losses occur, we estimate a 0.7 Pg C reduction in potential AGB. Thus, climate change has led to a decline of ~1/3 in the capacity of these disturbed forests to recover and recapture the C lost in disturbances during 1993-2012. Our approach further shows that annual variations in land use change mask the natural relationship between the El Niño/Southern Oscillation and AGB stocks in disturbed regions. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The critical temperature beyond which photosynthetic machinery in tropical trees begins to fail averages approximately 46.7 °C (T crit)1. However, it remains unclear whether leaf temperatures experienced by tropical vegetation approach this threshold or soon will under climate change. Here we found that pantropical canopy temperatures independently triangulated from individual leaf thermocouples, pyrgeometers and remote sensing (ECOSTRESS) have midday peak temperatures of approximately 34 °C during dry periods, with a long high-temperature tail that can exceed 40 °C. Leaf thermocouple data from multiple sites across the tropics suggest that even within pixels of moderate temperatures, upper canopy leaves exceed T crit 0.01% of the time. Furthermore, upper canopy leaf warming experiments (+2, 3 and 4 °C in Brazil, Puerto Rico and Australia, respectively) increased leaf temperatures non-linearly, with peak leaf temperatures exceeding T crit 1.3% of the time (11% for more than 43.5 °C, and 0.3% for more than 49.9 °C). Using an empirical model incorporating these dynamics (validated with warming experiment data), we found that tropical forests can withstand up to a 3.9 ± 0.5 °C increase in air temperatures before a potential tipping point in metabolic function, but remaining uncertainty in the plasticity and range of T crit in tropical trees and the effect of leaf death on tree death could drastically change this prediction. The 4.0 °C estimate is within the ‘worst-case scenario’ (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5) of climate change predictions2 for tropical forests and therefore it is still within our power to decide (for example, by not taking the RCP 6.0 or 8.5 route) the fate of these critical realms of carbon, water and biodiversity3,4. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Tropical dry forests (TDFs) present strong seasonal greenness signals ideal for tracking phenology and primary productivity using remote sensing techniques. The tightly synchronized relationship these ecosystems have with water availability offer a valuable natural experiment for observing the complex interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere in the tropics. To investigate how well the MODIS vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI)) represented the phenology of different successional stages of naturally regenerating TDFs, within a widely conserved forest fragment in the semi-arid southeast of Brazil, we installed several canopy towers with radiometric sensors to produce high temporal resolution near-surface vegetation greenness indices. Direct comparison of several years of ground measurements with a combined Aqua/Terra 8 day satellite product showed similar broad temporal trends, but MODIS often suffered from cloud contamination during the onset of the growing season and occasionally during the peak growing season. The strength of the in-situ and MODIS linear relationship was greater for NDVI than for EVI across sites but varied with forest stand age. Furthermore, we describe the onset dates and duration of canopy development phases for three years of in-situ monitoring. A seasonality analysis revealed significant discrepancies between tower and MODIS phenology transitions dates, with up to five weeks differences in growing season length estimation. Our results indicate that 8 and 16 day MODIS satellite vegetation monitoring products are suitable for tracking general patterns of tropical dry forest phenology in this region but are not temporally sufficient to characterize inter-annual differences in phenology phase onset dates or changes in productivity due to mid-season droughts. Such rapid transitions in canopy greenness are important indicators of climate change sensitivity of these already endangered forest ecosystems and should be further monitored using both ground and satellite approaches. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Forest landscape restoration is a global priority to mitigate negative effects of climate change, conserve biodiversity, and ensure future sustainability of forests, with international pledges concentrated in tropical forest regions. To hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests (90% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate (62%) and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management, regeneration dynamics, and structure. In a restoration context, we showed the ability of UAV-borne LiDAR to identify complex forest structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high accuracy. Future research may explore a fusion of UAV-borne LiDAR with optical sensors, and include successional stages in the analyses to further characterize and distinguish forest types and their contributions to landscape restoration. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Brazilian tropical ecosystems in the state of Mato Grosso have experienced significant land use and cover changes during the past few decades due to deforestation and wildfire. These changes can directly affect the mass and energy exchange near the surface and, consequently, evapotranspi-ration (ET). Characterization of the seasonal patterns of ET can help in understanding how these tropical ecosystems function with a changing climate. The goal of this study was to characterize temporal (seasonal-to-decadal) and spatial patterns in ET over Mato Grosso using remotely sensed products. Ecosystems over areas with limited to no flux towers can be performed using remote sensing products such as NASA’s MOD16A2 ET (MOD16 ET). As the accuracy of this product in tropical ecosystems is unknown, a secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the MOD16 ET (ETMODIS) to appropriately represent the spatial and seasonal ET patterns in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Actual ET was measured (ETMeasured) using eight flux towers, three in the Amazon, three in the Cerrado, and two in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso. In general, the ETMODIS of all sites had no significant difference from ETMeasured during all analyzed periods, and ETMODIS had a significant moderate to strong correlation with the ETMeasured. The spatial variation of ET had some similarity to the climatology of Mato Grosso, with higher ET in the mid to southern parts of Mato Grosso (Cerrado and Pantanal) during the wet period compared to the dry period. The ET in the Amazon had three seasonal patterns, a higher and lower ET in the wet season compared to the dry season, and minimal to insignificant variation in ET during the wet and dry seasons. The wet season ET in Amazon decreased from the first and second decades, but the ET during the wet and dry season increased in Cerrado and Pantanal in the same period. This study highlights the importance of deepening the study of ET in the state of Mato Grosso due to the land cover and climate change. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Tropical savanna ecosystems play a major role in the seasonality of the global carbon cycle. However, their ability to store and sequester carbon is uncertain due to combined and intermingling effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change, which impact wildfire regimes and vegetation dynamics. Accurate measurements of tropical savanna vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) over broad spatial scales are crucial to achieve effective carbon emission mitigation strategies. UAV-lidar is a new remote sensing technology that can enable rapid 3-D mapping of structure and related AGB in tropical savanna ecosystems. This study aimed to assess the capability of high-density UAV-lidar to estimate and map total (tree, shrubs, and surface layers) aboveground biomass density (AGBt) in the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado). Five ordinary least square regression models estimating AGBt were adjusted using 50 field sample plots (30 m × 30 m). The best model was selected under Akaike Information Criterion, adjusted coefficient of determination (adj.R2), absolute and relative root mean square error (RMSE), and used to map AGBt from UAV-lidar data collected over 1,854 ha spanning the three major vegetation formations (forest, savanna, and grassland) in Cerrado. The model using vegetation height and cover was the most effective, with an overall model adj-R2 of 0.79 and a leave-one-out cross-validated RMSE of 19.11 Mg/ha (33.40%). The uncertainty and errors of our estimations were assessed for each vegetation formation separately, resulting in RMSEs of 27.08 Mg/ha (25.99%) for forests, 17.76 Mg/ha (43.96%) for savannas, and 7.72 Mg/ha (44.92%) for grasslands. These results prove the feasibility and potential of the UAV-lidar technology in Cerrado but also emphasize the need for further developing the estimation of biomass in grasslands, of high importance in the characterization of the global carbon balance and for supporting integrated fire management activities in tropical savanna ecosystems. Our results serve as a benchmark for future studies aiming to generate accurate biomass maps and provide baseline data for efficient management of fire and predicted climate change impacts on tropical savanna ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Caatinga is the largest nucleus of Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF) in the Neotropics. The leafing patterns of SDTF vegetation are adapted to the current environmental and climate variability, but the impacts of climate change tend to alter plants’ phenology. Thus, it is necessary to characterise phenological parameters and evaluate the relationship between vegetation and environmental drivers. From this information, it is possible to identify the dominant forces in the environment that trigger the phenological dynamics of the Caatinga. In this way, remote sensing represents an essential tool to investigate the phenology of vegetation, particularly as it has a long series of vegetation monitoring and allows relationships with different environmental drivers. This study has two objectives: (i) estimate phenological parameters using an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time-series over 20 years, and (ii) characterise the relationship between phenologic dynamics and environmental drivers. TIMESAT software was used to determine four phenological parameters: Start Of Season (SOS), End Of Season (EOS), Length Of Season (LOS), and Amplitude (AMPL). Boxplots, Pearson’s, and partial correlation coefficients defined relationships between phenologic dynamics and environmental drivers. The non-parametric test of Fligner–Killeen was used to test the interannual variability in SOS and EOS. Our results show that the seasonality of vegetation growth in the Caatinga was different in the three experimental sites. The SOS was the parameter that presented the greatest variability in the days of the year (DOY), reaching a variation of 117 days. The sites with the highest SOS variability are the same ones that showed the lowest EOS variation. In addition, the values of LOS and AMPL are directly linked to the annual distribution of rainfall, and the longer the rainy season, the greater their values are. The variability of the natural cycles of the environmental drivers that regulate the ecosystem’s phenology and the influence on the Caatinga’s natural dynamics indicated a greater sensitivity of the phenologic dynamics to water availability, with precipitation being the limiting factor of the phenologic dynamics. Highlights: The EVI time series was efficient in estimating phenological parameters. The high variability of the start of season (SOS) occurred in sites with low variability of end of the season (EOS) and vice versa. The precipitation and water deficit presented a higher correlation coefficient with phenological dynamics. Length of Season (LOS) and amplitude (AMPL) are directly linked to the annual distribution of rainfall. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Determining the seasonality of terrestrial carbon exchange with the atmosphere remains a challenge in tropical forests because of the heterogeneity of ecosystem and climate. The magnitude and spatial variability of this flux are unknown, particularly in Amazonia where empirical upscaling approaches from spatially sparse in situ measurements and simulations from process-based models have been challenged in recent scientific literature. Here, we use satellite proxy observations of canopy structure, skin temperature, water content, and optical properties over a period of 10 years (2000-2009) to constrain and quantify the spatial pattern and seasonality of carbon exchange of Amazonian forests. We identify nine regions through an optimized cluster approach with distinct leaf phenology synchronized with either water or light availability and corresponding seasonal cycles of gross primary production (GPP), covering more than 600 million ha of remaining old growth forests of Amazonia. We find South and Southwestern regions show strong seasonality of GPP with a peak in the wet season; while from Central Western to Northeastern Amazonia cover three regions with rising GPP in the dry season. The remaining four regions have significant but weak seasonality. These patterns agree with satellite florescence observations, a better proxy for photosynthetic activity. Our results suggest that only one-third of the patterns can be explained by the spatial autocorrelation caused by intra-annual variability of climate over Amazonia. The remaining two-thirds of variations are due to biogeography of the Amazon basin driven by forest composition, structure, and nutrients. These patterns, for the first time, provide a complex picture of seasonal changes of tropical forests related to photosynthesis and influenced by water, light, and stomatal responses of trees that can improve modeling of regional carbon cycle and future prediction of impacts of climate change. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Cerrado is the second largest biome in South America and accounted for the second largest contribution to carbon emissions in Brazil for the last 10 years, mainly due to land-use changes. It comprises approximately 2 million km2 and is divided into 22 ecoregions, based on environmental conditions and vegetation. The most dominant vegetation type is cerrado sensu stricto (cerrado ss), a savanna woodland. Quantifying variation of biomass density of this vegetation is crucial for climate change mitigation policies. Integrating remote sensing data with adequate allometric equations and field-based data sets can provide large-scale estimates of biomass. We developed individual-tree aboveground biomass (AGB) allometric models to compare different regression techniques and explanatory variables. We applied the model with the strongest fit to a comprehensive ground-based data set (77 sites, 893 plots, and 95,484 trees) to describe AGB density variation of cerrado ss. We also investigated the influence of physiographic and climatological variables on AGB density; this analysis was restricted to 68 sites because eight sites could not be classified into a specific ecoregion, and one site had no soil texture data. In addition, we developed two models to estimate plot AGB density based on plot basal area. Our data show that for individual-tree AGB models a) log-log linear models provided better estimates than nonlinear power models; b) including species as a random effect improved model fit; c) diameter at 30 cm above ground was a reliable predictor for individual-tree AGB, and although height significantly improved model fit, species wood density did not. Mean tree AGB density in cerrado ss was 22.9 tons ha-1 (95% confidence interval = ± 2.2) and varied widely between ecoregions (8.8 to 42.2 tons ha-1), within ecoregions (e.g. 4.8 to 39.5 tons ha-1), and even within sites (24.3 to 69.9 tons ha-1). Biomass density tended to be higher in sites close to the Amazon. Ecoregion explained 42% of biomass variation between the 68 sites (P < 0.01) and shows strong potential as a parameter for classifying regional biomass variation in the Cerrado. © Public Library of Science.

	abstract = {Amazon forests are the largest forests in the tropics and play a fundamental role for regional and global ecosystem service provision. However, they are under threat primarily from deforestation. Amazonia's carbon balance trend reflects the condition of its forests. There are different approaches to estimate large-scale carbon balances, including top-down (e.g., CO2 atmospheric measurements combined with atmospheric transport information) and bottom-up (e.g., land use and cover change (LUCC) data based on remote sensing methods). It is important to understand their similarities and differences. Here we provide bottom-up LUCC estimates and determine to what extent they are consistent with recent top-down flux estimates during 2010 to 2018 for the Brazilian Amazon. We combine LUCC datasets resulting in annual LUCC maps from 2010 to 2018 with emissions and removals for each LUCC, and compare the resulting CO2 estimates with top-down estimates based on atmospheric measurements. We take into account forest carbon stock maps for estimating loss processes, and carbon uptake of regenerating and mature forests. In the bottom-up approach total CO2 emissions (2010 to 2018), deforestation and degradation are the largest contributing processes accounting for 58% (4.3 PgCO2) and 37% (2.7 PgCO2) respectively. Looking at the total carbon uptake, primary forests play a dominant role accounting for 79% (−5.9 PgCO2) and secondary forest growth for 17% (−1.2 PgCO2). Overall, according to our bottom-up estimates the Brazilian Amazon is a carbon sink until 2014 and a source from 2015 to 2018. In contrast according to the top-down approach the Brazilian Amazon is a source during the entire period. Both approaches estimate largest emissions in 2016. During the period where flux signs are the same (2015–2018) top-down estimates are approximately 3 times larger in 2015–2016 than bottom-up estimates while in 2017–2018 there is closer agreement. There is some agreement between the approaches–notably that the Brazilian Amazon has been a source during 2015–2018 however there are also disagreements. Generally, emissions estimated by the bottom-up approach tend to be lower. Understanding the differences will help improve both approaches and our understanding of the Amazon carbon cycle under human pressure and climate change.

	abstract = {Forest cover loss in the tropics is well known to cause warming at deforested sites, with maximum temperatures being particularly sensitive. Forest loss causes warming by altering local energy balance and surface roughness, local changes that can propagate across a wide range of spatial scales. Consequently, temperature increases result from not only changes in forest cover at a site, but also by the aggregate effects of non-local forest loss. We explored such non-local warming within Brazil's Amazon and Cerrado biomes, the region with the world's single largest amount of forest loss since 2000. Two datasets, one consisting of in-situ air temperature observations and a second, larger dataset consisting of ATs derived from remotely-sensed observations of land surface temperature, were used to quantify changes in maximum temperature due to forest cover loss at varying length-scales. We considered undisturbed forest locations (1 km2 in extent), and forest loss trends in annuli ('halos'), located 1-2 km, 2-4 km, 4-10 km and 10-50 km from these undisturbed sites. Our research finds significant and substantial non-local warming, suggesting that historical estimates of warming due to forest cover loss under-estimate warming or mis-attribute warming to local change, where non-local changes also influence the pattern of temperature warming. © 2019 The Author(s).

Interactions between the availabilities of water and phosphorus could theoretically either increase or decrease the susceptibility of tropical gas exchange to variation of precipitation. The inclusion of phosphorus-water interactions in a land surface model reduces the coefficient of variance, a measure of variability, of biweekly gross primary productivity by a factor of 1.5–2.3 at three tropical forest sites in Brazil, bringing it closer to estimates from eddy covariance measurements and remote sensing. Soil drought conditions are attenuated due to 8–30% lower water consumption during wet periods in presence of phosphorus limitation. When soils are dry, plant phosphorus acquisition is impaired by reduced ion mobility, despite an increase in net phosphorus mineralization. We conclude that water-phosphorus interactions cannot be omitted in analysis of the resilience of tropical ecosystems to precipitation changes. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

	abstract = {Leaf phenology represents a major temporal component of ecosystem functioning, and understanding the drivers of seasonal variation in phenology is essential to understand plant responses to climate change. We assessed the patterns and drivers of land surface phenology, a proxy for leafing phenology, for the meridional Espinhaço Range, a South American tropical mountain comprising a mosaic of savannas, dry woodlands, montane vegetation and moist forests. We used a 14-year time series of MODIS/NDVI satellite images, acquired between 2001 and 2015, and extracted phenological indicators using the TIMESAT algorithm. We obtained precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, land surface temperature from the MODIS MOD11A2 product, and cloud cover frequency from the MODIS MOD09GA product. We also calculated the topographic wetness index and simulated clear-sky radiation budgets based on the SRTM elevation model. The relationship between phenology and environmental drivers was assessed using general linear models. Temporal displacement in the start date of the annual growth season was more evident than variations in season length among vegetation types, indicating a possible temporal separation in the use of resources. Season length was inversely proportional to elevation, decreasing 1.58 days per 100 m. Green-up and senescence rates were faster where annual temperature amplitude was higher. We found that water and light availability, modulated by topography, are the most likely drivers of land surface phenology in the region, determining the start, end and length of the growing season. Temperature had an important role in determining the rates of leaf development and the strength of vegetation seasonality, suggesting that tropical vegetation is also sensitive to latitudinal temperature changes, regardless of the elevational gradient. Our work improves the current understanding of phenological strategies in the seasonal tropics and emphasizes the importance of topography in shaping light and water availability for leaf development in snow-free mountains. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Tropical ecosystems play a large and complex role in the global carbon cycle. Clearing of natural ecosystems for agriculture leads to large pulses of CO2 to the atmosphere from terrestrial biomass. Concurrently, the remaining intact ecosystems, especially tropical forests, may be sequestering a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere in response to global environmental changes including climate changes and an increase in atmospheric CO2 Here we use an approach that integrates census-based historical land use reconstructions, remote-sensing-based contemporary land use change analyses, and simulation modeling of terrestrial biogeochemistry to estimate the net carbon balance over the period 1901-2006 for the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, which is one of the most rapidly changing agricultural frontiers in the world. By the end of this period, we estimate that of the state's 925 225 km2, 221 092 km 2 have been converted to pastures and 89 533 km2 have been converted to croplands, with forest-to-pasture conversions being the dominant land use trajectory but with recent transitions to croplands increasing rapidly in the last decade. These conversions have led to a cumulative release of 4.8 Pg C to the atmosphere, with ∼80% from forest clearing and 20% from the clearing of cerrado. Over the same period, we estimate that the residual undisturbed ecosystems accumulated 0.3 Pg C in response to CO2 fertilization. Therefore, the net emissions of carbon from Mato Grosso over this period were 4.5 Pg C. Net carbon emissions from Mato Grosso since 2000 averaged 146 Tg C/yr, on the order of Brazil's fossil fuel emissions during this period. These emissions were ssociated with the expansion of croplands to grow soybeans. While alternative management regimes in croplands, including tillage, fertilization, and cropping patterns promote carbon storage in ecosystems, they remain a small portion of the net carbon balance for the region. This detailed accounting of a region's carbon balance is the type of foundation analysis needed by the new United Nations Collaborative Programmme for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	abstract = {As an important component of terrestrial ecosystem, vegetation acts as a sensitive recorder of changes in hydroclimatic conditions. Long-term time series of remote sensing-based vegetation indices and their influencing environmental driving factors, such as human activities and climate change, have been widely discussed in the literature. Globally, however, little is known about the hydroclimatic processes controlling vegetation changes in mountainous regions, which are conceived as more sensitive to climate change than other landscapes. The present study aims to quantify the respective roles of two dominant hydroclimatic factors, namely, TWS (i.e., terrestrial water storage) and Tair (i.e., temperature), in the spatio-temporal changes of mountainous vegetation over global six contrasting climate zones (i.e., tropical, arid, subtropical, temperate, sub-frigid, and frigid zones) during the period 2003–2016 based on EVI (i.e., enhanced vegetation index), TWS, Tair, and elevation data. Results indicate that the mean EVI shows a larger increasing trend (+0.85 %/decade, p-value < 0.01) and a larger decreasing trend in TWS (−85 mm/decade, p-value < 0.01) across the global mountainous regions than other global regions combined together (+0.61 %/decade, p-value < 0.01), particularly over high latitudes. With the increasing latitudes, the positive effect of temperature more dominates mountainous vegetation growth than moisture, as evidenced by the increasing trends of EVI with warming. However, in certain low-latitude mountainous regions (e.g., East Africa, South Asia, the western Tibetan Plateau, Brazil Plateau, and the southern Rocky Mountains), mountainous vegetation may face degradation due to water deficit induced by increased snowmelt, especially among the high-elevation ecosystems. The water availability controls vegetation activities more than Tair in the mid- and low-latitude regions, including the tropical, arid, and subtropical climate zones. These findings indicate that the potential shifts in mountainous vegetation may occur under the notable interactions with hydroclimatic factors, as the high-latitudes are experiencing ongoing warming and the mid- and low-latitudes are getting dryer. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

This rate does not capture spatial regrowth patterns due to environmental and disturbance drivers. Here we quantify the influence of such drivers on the rate and spatial patterns of regrowth in the Brazilian Amazon using satellite data. Carbon sequestration rates of young secondary forests (<20 years) in the west are ~60% higher (3.0 ± 1.0 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) compared to those in the east (1.3 ± 0.3 Mg C ha−1 yr−1). Disturbances reduce regrowth rates by 8–55%. The 2017 secondary forest carbon stock, of 294 Tg C, could be 8% higher by avoiding fires and repeated deforestation. Maintaining the 2017 secondary forest area has the potential to accumulate ~19.0 Tg C yr−1 until 2030, contributing ~5.5% to Brazil’s 2030 net emissions reduction target. Implementing legal mechanisms to protect and expand secondary forests whilst supporting old-growth conservation is, therefore, key to realising their potential as a nature-based climate solution. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {For a number of years there has been a growing concern in the scientific community about the rapid changes in tropical forest ecosystems. The potential consequences of these changes with respect to carbon budgets and climate change (Detwiler and Hall 1988; Gash and Nobre 1996; Zhang, McGuffie, and Henderson-Sellers 1996; Melillo et al. 1996; Steudler et al. 1996), loss of habitat and fear of species extinction (Skole and Tucker 1993; Turner 1996; Prance and Elias 1976), and erosion of indigenous people's rights and ways of living (Vickers 1994; Redford and Padoch 1992), combined with concerns of resource mismanagement and depletion (Myers 1996), have drawn increased attention to the fate of tropical forest ecosystems. The scientific community has called for an intensive effort to highlight and document areas of rapid land-cover change (Turner et al. 1995). These concerns are reflected both in international conventions (IPCC 1996) and in bilateral government actions to reduce the impact of deforestation. The European Union has a stated policy of supporting sustainable forest management and therefore spends several hundred million euros on tropical forest initiatives each year (Shepherd et al. 1998). However, severe criticism has been leveled that aid funding has been counterproductive (Rainforest Foundation 1998), inasmuch as the perceived solutions for rural development are often at odds with forest conservation. One of the most striking examples of this is the extension and improvement of the road systems in the forest domain (FAO 1999; Laurance et al. 2001). In such circumstances, the provision of timely and accurate data on the tropical forest extent and its changes can help to formulate conservation policies and maximize their impact, and at the same time can serve as an important input into development planning. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, which has a mandate to collect and publish global forest statistics, would be in theory such a data source (FAO 2001); however, these data are often difficult to compare between countries due to different classification systems, are not spatially explicit, and in some cases are simply extrapolations of historical data (Matthews 2001). The Joint Research Center of the European Commission initiated the Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation by Satellite (TREES) project in 1991 to develop a system for the monitoring of the extent, condition, and dynamics of the tropical forest belt at a global level. A crucial goal for the project was to develop techniques for highlighting areas undergoing rapid forest change so that appropriate political action and funding might be efficiently targeted (Malingreau et al. 1995). Over the last twenty years the use of observation satellites has become more commonplace as a remote sensing tool for documenting and estimating changes in land cover. The observations are carried out at different scales: There are fine spatial resolution observations from Landsat Thematic Mapper, for example, where a restricted scene of around 200 km width can be observed at a resolution of 30 m for a selected site once a month; there are also coarse spatial resolution observations from NOAA's advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR), where regional to continental scenes are acquired daily but with a poor spatial definition, at a resolution of about 1 km. While in theory a comprehensive coverage of the tropics using high spatial resolution data would reveal in detail the full extent of deforestation occurring at any one time, in practice the availability of imagery, the costs of acquisition and processing, and the huge amounts of data involved limit such efforts at global levels. The lack of sufficient imagery arises because cloud cover frequently obscures the target area in the tropics, and for a number of regions no ground stations exist, so that on-board satellite data storage is required. The latter depend on the space agencies, or on a paying customer. Coarse spatial resolution remote sensing data have the advantage of giving daily synoptic views over large, often inaccessible areas, allowing phenological analysis of the data. In many cases, near real-time data can be obtained, either through a local receiving station or through the space agencies via the World Wide Web. On the other hand, these data do not have sufficient spatial resolution to determine land-cover area change estimates accurately. In this chapter we describe the methods used to highlight areas of land-cover change in the humid forests of tropical South America, which contains about half of the world's remaining rainforest (Achard et al. 2002). Our objective was to use regional maps of forest cover and fire incidence, both derived from coarse resolution satellite data, in conjunction with expert opinion to highlight the major deforestation fronts in tropical South America. The resulting maps can be used to target projects aimed at supporting sustainable forest management accurately, to support public administration, to monitor the integrity of national parks and indigenous lands, and to focus studies that aim to measure forest change in these "hotspots." Our study encompasses the humid tropical forests of South America, which stretch from the Darien Gap in northwestern Colombia down the Choco, and across the Orinoco basin and Amazonian basins to the Guyanas (figure 24.1). On its eastern and southern edge the forest is bordered by the Brazilian cerrado and the Bolivian chaco, originally areas of dry forest and savanna, now predominantly agricultural. South of the equator, the western edge of the forest is delimited by the Andes mountain range. Within the vast humid forest domain of South America several large savannahs exist, notably the llanos of Colombia and Venezuela, the llanos de Mojos of Bolivia, and the Rio Branco/Rupunumi/Gran Sabana on the frontier of Brazil, Guyana, and Venezuela. While much of the area of dry forest had been exploited and converted to agriculture in colonial times, the humid forest areas have remained intact until the post-World War II period. Since then, major land-use changes have occurred due to economic growth and outmigration. The latter has arisen for a number of reasons: Isolation from markets and employment opportunities, lack of cultivable land, drought and civil disturbances, and few opportunities for producing cash crops (Preston 1996). The main migratory trends into the forest frontiers have been from the northeast of Brazil and from the Andes. In a number of countries the process has been encouraged by government grants, subsidies, and infrastructure improvements (Fearnside 1983; Nepstad et al. 1997). General economic growth at the national level has also stimulated these infrastructure improvements, leading to the construction and upgrading of ports and roads as well as increased mineral exploration and exploitation, all of which combine to make easier access to-and export from-the forested regions. The FAO forest area statistics show that the annual average net change rate for tropical South America between 1990 and 2000 was of the order of 0.4 percent; however, the data are not specifically spatially located, remaining aggregated at the country level (FAO 2001). There is a need therefore to provide decision makers with explicit information as to just where deforestation is occurring, along with comparative rates for the particular hotspots. © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press.

	abstract = {Estimates of the rate and extent of tropical deforestation differ widely. The accuracy of the estimates for many countries has improved greatly during the last decade, especially with increased use of satellite data and advancements in analysis techniques. A good basis for ongoing global monitoring of tropical forests has been established by the FAO in its Forest Resources Assessment for 1990 (though data for some countries are still inadequate). The FAO assessment estimates that over one million km2 of the Earth's tropical rain-forest and moist deciduous forest was destroyed during 1981–90, representing an annual deforestation rate of 0.75% of such forests throughout the decade. This paper traces the controversy over measurements of deforestation in Brazil's Legal Amazon and the resulting confusion and exaggeration of research findings (in both directions). Some widely-cited estimates are highly inaccurate, indicating a need for critical evaluation of any estimates that are used. A substantial narrowing of the range of estimates is found in recent studies. Landsat data indicate that the deforestation rate in the Legal Amazon declined considerably from 1988 to 1991. Accurate estimates of world-wide tropical deforestation are needed to assess the impact of deforestation on the buildup of ‘greenhouse’ gases and to monitor compliance with any protocols to be negotiated under the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change. Ongoing collection and analysis of satellite data is needed, and methods are being developed to archive and analyse efficiently the vast amounts of data involved. In promoting such a monitoring effort, it is important that scientists be sensitive to the political ramifications in developing countries, involve local experts in planning and implementation, and emphasize the local benefits of the data to be obtained. © 1995, Foundation for Environmental Conservation.

	abstract = {Coexisting vegetation types in tropical landscapes can respond in contrasting ways to rainfall, despite being in the same climatic envelope. Understanding such heterogeneity in vegetation-rainfall interactions is key for predicting how ecosystems might respond to future environmental changes. Here we test whether temporal coupling between vegetation greenness and rainfall is a good indicator of ecosystem state in the landscape. For this, we study a well-preserved landscape of the Brazilian Cerrado that is formed by mosaics of contrasting ecosystems, including savannas, dry forests and gallery forests. First, we correlate the time-series of rainfall and vegetation greenness to quantify their coupling for each vegetation type. We then compare vegetation-rainfall coupling with other state variables, such as local-scale vegetation structural and functional traits, as well as differences in environmental conditions in which these vegetation types exist. Coexisting vegetation types are set in contrasting local-scale environmental conditions and have distinct responsiveness to rainfall. Commonly used structural and functional state variables, such as tree cover and tree height, do not depict such marked differences between the vegetation types, particularly for gallery and dry forests. Dry forests have the strongest coupling and decrease their greenness during dry seasons, reflecting vegetation deciduousness on nutrient-richer soils. In contrast, gallery forests increase their greenness during the dry season, when direct radiation peaks, likely due to perennial access to groundwater. Savannas are less responsive to rainfall and have a more stable greenness throughout the year. Our findings suggest that heterogeneity in local abiotic conditions contribute to determining both vegetation distribution and ecosystem states in these tropical savanna landscapes. Changes in these conditions as a result of climate and land-use changes will likely alter the distribution of vegetation types in the future. Our functional metric may thus be useful for assessing future responses of tropical ecosystems to changes in precipitation. © 2023},

	abstract = {Caatinga biome, located in the Brazilian semi-arid region, is the most populous semi-arid region in the world, causing intensification in land degradation and loss of biodiversity over time. The main objective of this paper is to determine and analyze the changes in land cover and use, over time, on the biophysical parameters in the Caatinga biome in the semi-arid region of Brazil using remote sensing. Landsat-8 images were used, along with the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in the Google Earth Engine platform, from 2013 to 2019, through spatiotemporal modeling of vegetation indices, i.e., leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation cover (VC). Moreover, land surface temperature (LST) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa ) in Petrolina, the semi-arid region of Brazil, was used. The principal component analysis was used to select descriptive variables and multiple regression analysis to predict ETa . The results indicated significant effects of land use and land cover changes on energy balances over time. In 2013, 70.2% of the study area was composed of Caatinga, while the lowest percentages were identified in 2015 (67.8%) and 2017 (68.7%). Rainfall records in 2013 ranged from 270 to 480 mm, with values higher than 410 mm in 46.5% of the study area, concentrated in the northern part of the municipality. On the other hand, in 2017 the lowest annual rainfall values (from 200 to 340 mm) occurred. Low vegetation cover rate was observed by LAI and VC values, with a range of 0 to 25% vegetation cover in 52.3% of the area, which exposes the effects of the dry season on vegetation. The highest LST was mainly found in urban areas and/or exposed soil. In 2013, 40.5% of the region’s area had LST between 48.0 and 52.0◦C, raising ETa rates (~4.7 mm day−1 ). Our model has shown good outcomes in terms of accuracy and concordance (coefficient of determination = 0.98, root mean square error = 0.498, and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient = 0.907). The significant increase in agricultural areas has resulted in the progressive reduction of the Caatinga biome. Therefore, mitigation and sustainable planning is vital to decrease the impacts of anthropic actions. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Fragmented tropical forest landscapes preserve much of the remaining biodiversity and carbon stocks. Climate change is expected to intensify droughts and increase fire hazard and fire intensities, thereby causing habitat deterioration, and losses of biodiversity and carbon stock losses. Understanding the trajectories that these landscapes may follow under increased climate pressure is imperative for establishing strategies for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here, we used a quantitative predictive modelling approach to project the spatial distribution of the aboveground biomass density (AGB) by the end of the 21st century across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) domain. To develop the models, we used the maximum entropy method with projected climate data to 2100, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 from the fifth Assessment Report. Our AGB models had a satisfactory performance (area under the curve > 0.75 and p value <.05). The models projected a significant increase of 8.5% in the total carbon stock. Overall, the projections indicated that 76.9% of the AF domain would have suitable climatic conditions for increasing biomass by 2100 considering the RCP 4.5 scenario, in the absence of deforestation. Of the existing forest fragments, 34.7% are projected to increase their AGB, while 2.6% are projected to have their AGB reduced by 2100. The regions likely to lose most AGB—up to 40% compared to the baseline—are found between latitudes 13° and 20° south. Overall, although climate change effects on AGB vary latitudinally for the 2071–2100 period under the RCP 4.5 scenario, our model indicates that AGB stocks can potentially increase across a large fraction of the AF. The patterns found here are recommended to be taken into consideration during the planning of restoration efforts, as part of climate change mitigation strategies in the AF and elsewhere in Brazil. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Our limited understanding of the climate controls on tropical forest seasonality is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in modeling climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Combining leaf production, litterfall and climate observations from satellite and ground data in the Amazon forest, we show that seasonal variation in leaf production is largely triggered by climate signals, specifically, insolation increase (70.4% of the total area) and precipitation increase (29.6%). Increase of insolation drives leaf growth in the absence of water limitation. For these non-water-limited forests, the simultaneous leaf flush occurs in a sufficient proportion of the trees to be observed from space. While tropical cycles are generally defined in terms of dry or wet season, we show that for a large part of Amazonia the increase in insolation triggers the visible progress of leaf growth, just like during spring in temperate forests. The dependence of leaf growth initiation on climate seasonality may result in a higher sensitivity of these ecosystems to changes in climate than previously thought.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

	abstract = {Changes in environmental conditions, geographical variability and different sensor properties typically make it almost impossible to employ previously trained classifiers for new data without a significant drop in classification accuracy. Domain adaptation (DA) techniques been proven useful to alleviate that problem. In particular, appearance adaptation techniques may be used to adapt images from a specific dataset in such a way that the generated images have a style that is similar to the images from another dataset. Such techniques are, however, prone to creating artifacts that hinder proper classification of the adapted images. In this work we propose an unsupervised DA approach for change detection tasks, which is based on a particular appearance adaptation method: the Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN). Specifically, we extend that method by introducing additional constraints in the training phase of the model components, which make it preserve the semantic structure and class transitions in the adapted images. We evaluate the proposed approach on a deforestation detection application, considering different sites in the Amazon rain-forest and in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) using Landsat-8 images. In the experiments, each site corresponds to a domain, and the accuracy of a classifier trained with images and references from one (source) domain is measured in the classification of another (target) domain. The results show that the proposed approach is successful in producing artifact-free adapted images, which can be satisfactory classified by the pre-trained source classifiers. On average, the accuracies achieved in the classification of the adapted images outperformed the baselines (when no adaptation was made) by 7.1% in terms of mean average precision, and 9.1% in terms of F1-Score. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first unsupervised domain adaptation approach devised for change detection. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

	abstract = {Climate change is a challenge to the global community and one of the causes is the increase of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide (CO2). The major emission source of this gas into the atmosphere comes from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass burning, on the other hand, the main sink comes from biochemical processes such as photosynthesis. Thus, the observation of CO2 is a key point to understanding sources and sinks. In this context, The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) and 3 (OCO-3), are a NASA dedicated mission to monitor the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) on a global scale. We combined the OCO-2 and OCO-3 observations to study the spatial distribution of XCO2 anomalies and how some of these anomalies are related to fire occurrence in the Brazilian Biomes during 2020 and 2021 considering two different seasons, Dry and Wet. The fire occurrence was obtained from Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) that provides the data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product of active fires and thermal anomalies at Near-Real Time (MCD14DL, collection 6). The OCO-2/3 observations are affected by cloud formations in wet seasons, we observe that the dry period has more observations. The XCO2 anomaly values range from ∼ 7.0 ppm to −7.0 ppm and mostly positive anomalies occur in Amazon Biome, and this ecosystem has higher average values for all periods (∼0.9 ppm), compared to the other biomes. The fire occurrence was higher in dry periods, especially in 2020 when unprecedented fire outbreaks were registered in Brazil. The most affected biomes were Pantanal, Cerrado, and Amazon. XCO2 positive anomalies spatially agree with fire foci over some areas, and the correlation values between them ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 depending on the biome and season, and when considering observations with clouds the correlation is slightly higher. We point out for the first time the possibility of using OCO-2 and 3 combined, also, how positive XCO2 anomalies are related to fire occurrence in different ecosystems and periods, and the role of cloud detection in this relationship. © 2024 COSPAR},

	abstract = {Deforestation has a significant impact on the environment, accelerating global warming and causing irreversible damage to ecosystems. Large-scale deforestation monitoring techniques still mostly rely on statistical approaches and traditional machine learning models applied to multi-spectral, optical satellite imagery and meta-data like land cover maps. However, clouds often obstruct observations of land in optical satellite imagery, especially in the tropics, which limits their effectiveness. Moreover, statistical approaches and traditional machine learning methods may not capture the wide range of underlying distributions in deforestation data due to limited model capacity. To overcome these drawbacks, we apply an attention-based neural network architecture that learns to detect deforestation end-to-end from time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR data are mostly independent of the weather conditions and our trained neural network model generalizes across a wide range of deforestation patterns of Amazon forests. We curate a new dataset, called BraDD-S1TS, comprising approximately 25,000 image sequences for deforested and unchanged land throughout the Brazilian Amazon. We experimentally evaluate our method† on this dataset and compare it to state-of-the-art approaches. We find it outperforms still-in-use methods by 13.7 percentage points in intersection over union (IoU). We make BraDD-S1TS‡ publicly available along with this publication to serve as a novel testbed for comparing different deforestation detection methods in future studies. © Author(s) 2023.
