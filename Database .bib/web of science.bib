Abstract = {Amazon forests are the largest forests in the tropics and play a
   fundamental role for regional and global ecosystem service provision.
   However, they are under threat primarily from deforestation. Amazonia's
   carbon balance trend reflects the condition of its forests. There are
   different approaches to estimate large-scale carbon balances, including
   top-down (e.g., CO2 atmospheric measurements combined with atmospheric
   transport information) and bottom-up (e.g., land use and cover change
   (LUCC) data based on remote sensing methods). It is important to
   understand their similarities and differences. Here we provide bottom-up
   LUCC estimates and determine to what extent they are consistent with
   recent top-down flux estimates during 2010 to 2018 for the Brazilian
   Amazon. We combine LUCC datasets resulting in annual LUCC maps from 2010
   to 2018 with emissions and removals for each LUCC, and compare the
   resulting CO2 estimates with top-down estimates based on atmospheric
   measurements. We take into account forest carbon stock maps for
   estimating loss processes, and carbon uptake of regenerating and mature
   forests. In the bottom-up approach total CO2 emissions (2010 to 2018),
   deforestation and degradation are the largest contributing processes
   accounting for 58\% (4.3 PgCO(2)) and 37\% (2.7 PgCO(2)) respectively.
   Looking at the total carbon uptake, primary forests play a dominant role
   accounting for 79\% (-5.9 PgCO(2)) and secondary forest growth for 17\%
   (-1.2 PgCO(2)). Overall, according to our bottom-up estimates the
   Brazilian Amazon is a carbon sink until 2014 and a source from 2015 to
   2018. In contrast according to the top-down approach the Brazilian
   Amazon is a source during the entire period. Both approaches estimate
   largest emissions in 2016. During the period where flux signs are the
   same (2015-2018) top-down estimates are approximately 3 times larger in
   2015-2016 than bottom-up estimates while in 2017-2018 there is closer
   agreement. There is some agreement between the approaches-notably that
   the Brazilian Amazon has been a source during 2015-2018 however there
   are also disagreements. Generally, emissions estimated by the bottom-up
   approach tend to be lower. Understanding the differences will help
   improve both approaches and our understanding of the Amazon carbon cycle
   under human pressure and climate change.},
