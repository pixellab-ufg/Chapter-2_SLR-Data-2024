abstract = {Forests are a critical component of the planet's ecosystem. Unfortunately, there has been significant degradation in forest cover over recent decades as a result of logging, conversion to crop, plantation, and pasture land, or disasters (natural or man made) such as forest fires, floods, and hurricanes. As a result, significant attention is being given to the sustainable use of forests. A key to effective forest management is quantifiable knowledge about changes in forest cover. This requires identification and characterization of changes and the discovery of the relationship between these changes and natural and anthropogenic variables. In this article, we present our preliminary efforts and achievements in addressing some of these tasks along with the challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed in the future. At a higher level, our goal is to provide an overview of the exciting opportunities and challenges in developing and applying data mining approaches to provide critical information for forest and land use management.},

It continues to provide a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design and implementation aspects of geospatial data ranging from applications, user interfaces and visualization, to data storage, query processing, indexing, machine learning and data mining. The conference is the premier annual event of the ACM Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (ACM SIGSPATIAL).},

abstract = {Vespa mandarina is one of the largest and most dangerous wasps in the world. Its invasion will bring great challenges to the local ecological balance and environmental security. Based on 8 climatic factors and 6 geographical factors, the suitable habitat, migration trend and living conditions of this species in North America were predicted and analyzed by MaxEnt niche model. The results showed that precision of cold quarter, min temperature of cold month and mean temperature of cold quarter were the three most important environmental factors affecting the distribution of Vespa mandarina; The most suitable climatic conditions for the survival of this species are the average annual temperature of 23.3 ℃ - 27.8 ℃, the precipitation in the driest season of 370mm-720mm and the precipitation in the coldest season of 850mm-1600mm; At the same time, the most suitable geographical environment for its survival is the coniferous forest or broad-leaved forest with an altitude of - 20m-100m, loam or sandy soil and a coverage rate of more than 75\%; At present, the suitable areas of Vespa mandarina is mainly distributed in temperate or tropical areas such as the western coast of Canada, the northwest and eastern coast of the United States and Latin America, and the suitable area of Vespa mandarina will decrease under various CO2 emission scenarios in the future; In the future, the species will mainly start from the west coast of Washington state and migrate along the coastline to Alaska in the north and the Central American isthmus in the south.},

Through three and a half years of iterative fieldwork and system design, we have developed a deep understanding of their synthetic research practices, specifically regarding meta-studies. Here we detail the challenges researchers face conducting meta-studies and how this collective effort advances the entire scholarly community. We illustrate how our understanding of this synthetic research practice informs the design and refinement of cyberinfrastructure to better support their work.},
