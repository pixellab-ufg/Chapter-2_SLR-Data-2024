Spatial and interannual variability in the seasonal flood pulse is a fundamental ecological driver in these ecosystems. This study analyzes optical imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite to determine the extent and seasonal patterns of inundation over five years in the northern Pantanal, a Ramsar site renowned for its wildlife. The study site is bordered by the Cuiab&aacute; and S&atilde;o Louren&ccedil;o rivers, each with distinct flow regimes. Inundation patterns were revealed with a combination of water indices, supervised classification of land cover, and a digital elevation model. Total extent of flooding was underestimated by the optical imagery, but open water bodies were readily delineated with the land cover classification.<br/></div> &copy; 2023 by the authors.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">The Caatinga is the largest nucleus of Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF) in the Neotropics. The leafing patterns of SDTF vegetation are adapted to the current environmental and climate variability, but the impacts of climate change tend to alter plants&rsquo; phenology. Thus, it is necessary to characterise phenological parameters and evaluate the relationship between vegetation and environmental drivers. From this information, it is possible to identify the dominant forces in the environment that trigger the phenological dynamics of the Caatinga. In this way, remote sensing represents an essential tool to investigate the phenology of vegetation, particularly as it has a long series of vegetation monitoring and allows relationships with different environmental drivers. This study has two objectives: (i) estimate phenological parameters using an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time-series over 20 years, and (ii) characterise the relationship between phenologic dynamics and environmental drivers. TIMESAT software was used to determine four phenological parameters: Start Of Season (SOS), End Of Season (EOS), Length Of Season (LOS), and Amplitude (AMPL). Boxplots, Pearson&rsquo;s, and partial correlation coefficients defined relationships between phenologic dynamics and environmental drivers. The non-parametric test of Fligner&ndash;Killeen was used to test the interannual variability in SOS and EOS. Our results show that the seasonality of vegetation growth in the Caatinga was different in the three experimental sites. The SOS was the parameter that presented the greatest variability in the days of the year (DOY), reaching a variation of 117 days. The sites with the highest SOS variability are the same ones that showed the lowest EOS variation. In addition, the values of LOS and AMPL are directly linked to the annual distribution of rainfall, and the longer the rainy season, the greater their values are. The variability of the natural cycles of the environmental drivers that regulate the ecosystem&rsquo;s phenology and the influence on the Caatinga&rsquo;s natural dynamics indicated a greater sensitivity of the phenologic dynamics to water availability, with precipitation being the limiting factor of the phenologic dynamics. Highlights: The EVI time series was efficient in estimating phenological parameters. The high variability of the start of season (SOS) occurred in sites with low variability of end of the season (EOS) and vice versa. The precipitation and water deficit presented a higher correlation coefficient with phenological dynamics. Length of Season (LOS) and amplitude (AMPL) are directly linked to the annual distribution of rainfall.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The main objective of this paper is to determine and analyze the changes in land cover and use, over time, on the biophysical parameters in the Caatinga biome in the semi-arid region of Brazil using remote sensing. Landsat-8 images were used, along with the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in the Google Earth Engine platform, from 2013 to 2019, through spatiotemporal modeling of vegetation indices, i.e., leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation cover (V<inf>C</inf>). Moreover, land surface temperature (LST) and actual evapotranspiration (ET<inf>a</inf> ) in Petrolina, the semi-arid region of Brazil, was used. The principal component analysis was used to select descriptive variables and multiple regression analysis to predict ET<inf>a</inf> . The results indicated significant effects of land use and land cover changes on energy balances over time. In 2013, 70.2% of the study area was composed of Caatinga, while the lowest percentages were identified in 2015 (67.8%) and 2017 (68.7%). Rainfall records in 2013 ranged from 270 to 480 mm, with values higher than 410 mm in 46.5% of the study area, concentrated in the northern part of the municipality. On the other hand, in 2017 the lowest annual rainfall values (from 200 to 340 mm) occurred. Low vegetation cover rate was observed by LAI and V<inf>C</inf> values, with a range of 0 to 25% vegetation cover in 52.3% of the area, which exposes the effects of the dry season on vegetation. The highest LST was mainly found in urban areas and/or exposed soil. In 2013, 40.5% of the region&rsquo;s area had LST between 48.0 and 52.0<sup>&#9702;</sup>C, raising ET<inf>a</inf> rates (~4.7 mm day<sup>&minus;1</sup> ). Our model has shown good outcomes in terms of accuracy and concordance (coefficient of determination = 0.98, root mean square error = 0.498, and Lin&rsquo;s concordance correlation coefficient = 0.907). The significant increase in agricultural areas has resulted in the progressive reduction of the Caatinga biome. Therefore, mitigation and sustainable planning is vital to decrease the impacts of anthropic actions.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">In tropical forests, leaf phenology signals leaf-on/off status and exhibits considerable variability across scales from a single tree-crown to the entire forest ecosystem. Such phenology signals importantly regulate large-scale biogeochemical cycles and regional climate. PlanetScope CubeSats data with a 3-m resolution and near-daily global coverage provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor both fine- and ecosystem-scale phenology variability along large environmental gradients. However, a scalable method that accurately characterizes leaf phenology from PlanetScope with biophysically meaningful metrics remains lacking. We developed an index-guided, ecologically constrained autoencoder (IG-ECAE) method to automatically derive a deciduousness metric (percentage of upper tree canopies with leaf-off status within an image pixel) from PlanetScope. The IG-ECAE first estimated the reflectance spectra of leafy/leafless canopies based on their spectral indices characteristics, then used the derived reflectance spectra to guide an autoencoder deep learning method with additional ecological constraints to refine the reflectance spectra, and finally used linear spectral unmixing to estimate the relative abundance of leafless canopies (or deciduousness) per PlanetScope image pixel. We tested the IG-ECAE method at 16 tropical forest sites spanning multiple continents and a large precipitation gradient (1470&ndash;2819 mm year<sup>&minus;1</sup>). Among these sites, we evaluated the PlanetScope-derived deciduousness against corresponding measures derived from WorldView-2 (n = 9 sites) and local phenocams (n = 9 sites). Our results show that PlanetScope-derived deciduousness agrees: 1) with that derived from WorldView-2 at the patch level (90 m &times; 90 m) with r<sup>2</sup> = 0.89 across all sites; and 2) with that derived from phenocams to quantify ecosystem-scale seasonality with r<sup>2</sup> ranging from 0.62 to 0.96. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of IG-ECAE in characterizing the wide variability in deciduousness across scales from pixels to forest ecosystems, and from a single date to the full annual cycle, indicating the potential for using high-resolution satellites to track the large-scale phenological patterns and response of tropical forests to climate change.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Bioclimatic envelope models have been extensively used to predict the vegetation dynamics in response to climate changes. However, they are prone to the uncertainties arising from General Circulation Models (GCMs), classification algorithms and predictors, with low-resolution results and little detail at the regional level. Novel research has focused on the improvement of these models through a combination of climate and soil predictors to enhance ecological consistency. In this framework, we aimed to apply a joint edaphoclimatic envelope to predict the current and future vegetation distribution in the semiarid region of Brazil, which encompasses several classes of vegetation in response to the significant environmental heterogeneity. We employed a variety of machine learning algorithms and GCMs under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), in 1 km resolution. The combination of climate and soil predictors resulted in higher detail at landscape-scale and better distinction of vegetations with overlapping climatic niches. In forecasts, soil predictors imposed a buffer effect on vegetation dynamics as they reduced shifts driven solely by climatic drift. Our results with the edaphoclimatic approach pointed to an expansion of the dry Caatinga vegetation, ranging from an average of 16% to 24% on RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The shift in environmental suitability from forest to open and dry vegetation implies a major loss to biodiversity, as well as compromising the provision of ecosystem services important for maintaining the economy and livelihoods of the world's largest semiarid population. Predicting the most susceptible regions to future climate change is the first step in developing strategies to mitigate impacts in these areas.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Conserving tropical forests is crucial for the environment and future of our climate. Tropical rainforests worldwide, including the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA), offer exceptional ecosystem services. However, the disturbances that have been occurring more frequently within them are endangering their key role in tackling climate change. An alternative approach for preserving the intact forests that remain in the BLA is the delimitation of Indigenous Lands (ILs), which can, additionally, ensure the well-being of the traditional peoples inhabiting there. An increase in deforestation rates of the BLA in recent years, due to the weakening of the Brazilian environmental policy, is not confined to unprotected areas but is also occurring within ILs. Under this scenario, mining, not allowed in ILs, is a growing threat in these protected areas. Thus, using the freely available MapBiomas dataset, we have quantified for the first time the total mining area within ILs of the BLA from 1985 to 2020. Such activity jumped from 7.45 km<sup>2</sup> in 1985 to 102.16 km<sup>2</sup> in 2020, an alarming increase of 1271%. Three ILs (Kayap&oacute;, Munduruk&uacute;, and Yanomami) concentrated 95% of the mining activity within ILs in 2020 and, therefore, they require closer monitoring. Most of the mining in ILs in 2020 (99.5%) was related to gold extraction. A total of 25 of the 31 ILs of the BLA where mining activity was detected in at least one of 36 years analyzed (~81% of them) had a statistically significant increasing trend according to the Mann&ndash;Kendall test at 5%. The datasets used or cited in this study (MapBiomas, PRODES, and DETER) enable the monitoring of the current status of ILs, and the identification of emerging trends related to illegal activities. Therefore, they are critical tools for legal authorities.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 by the authors.},

Evidence of reservoir response in low latitudes is still limited. In this study, the vertical profile of water temperature in the Barra Bonita Reservoir (Brazil) is simulated using the one-dimensional General Lake Model (GLM), calibrated, and validated using in-situ data. Water temperature and reservoir hydrodynamics are simulated over 26&nbsp;years (1993&ndash;2018) to investigate warming trends, seasonal patterns, Schmidt stability, and the number of stratified days per year. Results indicate that the reservoir has experienced significant warming since 1993 related to increasing air temperature and decreasing wind speed. Water temperature increases (p value &lt;0.001) from the surface (+ 1.02&nbsp;&deg;C per decade) to the bottom (0.33&nbsp;&deg;C per decade). Higher warming rates are detected during the dry and cold season. Significant increasing trends are found for Schmidt stability and in the number of stratified days per year. Deepwater warming is directly related to increasing air temperature and frequent mixing episodes which transfer heat from surface to bottom waters. A deep outlet structure and an artificially controlled water level may enhance deepwater warming during the dry season. Our findings contribute to the understanding of subtropical reservoirs&rsquo; response to climate change and help to guide planning strategies for ensuring the security of water storage and ecosystem services they provide.<br/></div> &copy; 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

Wind speed, rainfall, forest structure, and hydro-geomorphology are known to influence mangrove damage and recovery following cyclones in the NAB. However, previous studies have focused on local-scale responses and individual cyclonic events. Here, we analyze 25 years (1996-2020) of mangrove vulnerability (damage after a cyclone) and 24 years (1996-2019) of short-term resilience (recovery after damage) for the NAB and subregions, using multi-annual, remote sensing-derived databases. We applied machine learning to characterize the influence of 22 potential variables on mangrove responses, including previously researched and new ones such as human development and long-term climate trends. Rates and drivers of mangrove vulnerability and resilience vary across NAB subregions, and hotspots of cyclone impact, mangrove damage, and loss of resilience are presented in this study. Cyclones characteristics mainly drive vulnerability at the regional level, while resilience is driven by site-specific conditions. These include long-term climate trends, pre-cyclone habitat structure, soil organic carbon stock, and human interventions on the land. We highlight that loss of resilience occurs mostly in areas undergoing long-term drought across the NAB, and coastal development influences both vulnerability and resilience at the subregional level. Thus, the impacts of increasing cyclone activity on mangroves and their ecosystem services such as coastal protection need to be framed in the context of climate change compound effects and heavy human influences in the region.

This study aimed to assess the capability of high-density UAV-lidar to estimate and map total (tree, shrubs, and surface layers) aboveground biomass density (AGBt) in the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado). Five ordinary least square regression models estimating AGBt were adjusted using 50 field sample plots (30 m &times; 30 m). The best model was selected under Akaike Information Criterion, adjusted coefficient of determination (adj.R<sup>2</sup>), absolute and relative root mean square error (RMSE), and used to map AGBt from UAV-lidar data collected over 1,854 ha spanning the three major vegetation formations (forest, savanna, and grassland) in Cerrado. The model using vegetation height and cover was the most effective, with an overall model adj-R<sup>2</sup> of 0.79 and a leave-one-out cross-validated RMSE of 19.11 Mg/ha (33.40%). The uncertainty and errors of our estimations were assessed for each vegetation formation separately, resulting in RMSEs of 27.08 Mg/ha (25.99%) for forests, 17.76 Mg/ha (43.96%) for savannas, and 7.72 Mg/ha (44.92%) for grasslands. These results prove the feasibility and potential of the UAV-lidar technology in Cerrado but also emphasize the need for further developing the estimation of biomass in grasslands, of high importance in the characterization of the global carbon balance and for supporting integrated fire management activities in tropical savanna ecosystems. Our results serve as a benchmark for future studies aiming to generate accurate biomass maps and provide baseline data for efficient management of fire and predicted climate change impacts on tropical savanna ecosystems.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Extreme weather events are likely to become more frequent in the 21st century bringing significant impacts to coastal ecosystems. However, the capacity to detect and measure those impacts are still limited, with effects largely unstudied. In June 2016, a hailstorm with wind gusts of over 100 km&middot;h<sup>&minus;1</sup> caused an unprecedented mangrove dieback on Eastern Brazil. To quantify the scale of impact and short-term recovery of mangroves (15-mo), we used satellite imagery and field sampling to evaluate changes in forest structure in control and impacted areas after the hailstorm. Satellite imagery revealed mangrove dieback in over 500 ha, corresponding to 29.3% of the total forest area suddenly impacted after the hailstorm. Fifteen months after the hailstorm, some impacted areas show an initial recovery, while others continued to degrade. The El Ni&ntilde;o years of 2014&ndash;2016 created mild drought conditions in Eastern Brazil. As observed in wetlands of semi-arid regions during the same period, mangrove recovery may have been impaired by continued physiological stress and climate change effects. Economic losses in the study site from typical mangrove ecosystem services including food provision, climate regulation, raw materials and nurseries are estimated to at least US$ 792,624 yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>. This is the first evidence of an extreme weather impact on mangroves in Brazil that typically provide unique ecological and economic subsistence to coastal populations. Our results reveal that there is a pressing need for long-term monitoring and climate change adaptation actions for coastal wetlands in Brazil, and to provide broad estimates of ecosystem values associated with these ecosystems given many areas are already experiencing chronic stress from local impacts, drought and high temperatures.<br/> &copy; 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Previous studies examining the underlying patterns of the complex relationship between canopy height and its environmental and climatic determinants suffered from the scarcity of accurate canopy height measurements at large scales. NASA&rsquo;s mission, the Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI), has provided sampled observations of the forest vertical structure at near global scale since late 2018. The availability of such unprecedented measurements allows for examining the vertical structure of vegetation spatially and temporally. Herein, we explore the most influential climatic and environmental drivers of the canopy height in tropical forests. We examined different resampling resolutions of GEDI-based canopy height to approximate maximum canopy height over tropical forests across all of Malaysia. Moreover, we attempted to interpret the dynamics underlining the bivariate and multivariate relationships between canopy height and its climatic and topographic predictors including world climate data and topographic data. The approaches to analyzing these interactions included machine learning algorithms, namely, generalized linear regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosting with tree and Dart implementations. Water availability, represented as the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, annual mean temperature and elevation gradients were found to be the most influential determinants of canopy height in Malaysia&rsquo;s tropical forest landscape. The patterns observed are in line with the reported global patterns and support the hydraulic limitation hypothesis and the previously reported negative trend for excessive water supply. Nevertheless, different breaking points for excessive water supply and elevation were identified in this study, and the canopy height relationship with water availability observed to be less significant for the mountainous forest on altitudes higher than 1000 m. This study provides insights into the influential factors of tree height and helps with better comprehending the variation in canopy height in tropical forests based on GEDI measurements, thereby supporting the development and interpretation of ecosystem modeling, forest management practices and monitoring forest response to climatic changes in montane forests.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 by the authors.

abstract = {Accurate estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests are critical for supporting strategies of ecosystem functioning conservation and climate change mitigation. However, such estimates at regional and local scales are still highly uncertain. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can characterize the structural and functional diversity of forests with high accuracy at a sub-meter resolution, and potentially improve the AGB estimations. In this study, we compared the ability of different data sources (airborne LiDAR and HSI, and their combination) and regression methods (linear model - LM, linear model with ridge regularization - LMR, Support Vector Regression - SVR, Random Forest - RF, Stochastic Gradient Boosting - SGB, and Cubist - CB) to improve AGB predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used georeferenced inventory data from 132 sample plots to obtain a reference field AGB and calculated 333 metrics (45 from LiDAR and 288 from HSI) that could be used as predictors for statistical AGB models. We submitted the metrics to a correlation filtering followed by a feature selection procedure (recursive feature elimination) to optimize the performance of the models and to reduce their complexity. Results showed that both LiDAR and HSI data used alone provided relatively high accurate models if adequate metrics and algorithms are chosen (RMSE = 67.6 Mg.ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>, RMSE% = 36%, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.58, for the best LiDAR model; RMSE = 68.1 Mg.ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>, RMSE% = 36%, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.58, for the best HSI model). However, HSI-only models required more metrics (5&ndash;12) than LiDAR-only models (2&ndash;5). Models combining metrics from both datasets resulted in more accurate AGB estimates, regardless of the regression method (RMSE = 57.7 Mg.ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>, RMSE% = 31%, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.70, for the best model). The most important LiDAR metrics for estimating AGB were related to the upper canopy cover and tree height percentiles, while the most important HSI metrics were associated with the near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions, particularly the leaf/canopy water and lignin-cellulose absorption bands. Finally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the remote sensing data source (LiDAR, HSI, or their combination) had a greater effect size than the regression algorithms. Thus, no single algorithm outperformed the others, although the LM method was less suitable when applied to the HSI and hybrid datasets. Results show that the synergistic use of LiDAR and hyperspectral data has great potential for improving the accuracy of the biomass estimates in the Brazilian Amazon.<br/> &copy; 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

Secondary forests recover remarkably fast in species richness but slowly in species composition. Secondary forests take a median time of five decades to recover the species richness of old-growth forest (80% recovery after 20 years) based on rarefaction analysis. Full recovery of species composition takes centuries (only 34% recovery after 20 years).

To hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests (90% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate (62%) and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management, regeneration dynamics, and structure. In a restoration context, we showed the ability of UAV-borne LiDAR to identify complex forest structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high accuracy. Future research may explore a fusion of UAV-borne LiDAR with optical sensors, and include successional stages in the analyses to further characterize and distinguish forest types and their contributions to landscape restoration.<br/></div> &copy; 2023 The Authors},

Yet, rapidly growing populations are driving continued degradation of tropical forests to supply wood products. The United Nations (UN) has developed the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programme to mitigate climate impacts and biodiversity losses through improved forest management. Consistent and reliable systems are still needed to monitor tropical forests at large scales, however, degradation has largely been left out of most REDD+ reporting given the lack of effective monitoring and countries mainly focus on deforestation. Recent advances in combining optical data and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have shown promise for improved ability to monitor forest losses, but it remains unclear if similar improvements could be made in detecting and mapping forest degradation. We used detailed selective logging records from three lowland tropical forest regions in the Brazilian Amazon to test the effectiveness of combining Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 for selective logging detection. We built Random Forest models to classify pixelbased differences in logged and unlogged regions to understand if combining optical and SAR improved the detection capabilities over optical data alone. We found that the classification accuracy of models utilizing optical data from Landsat 8 alone were slightly higher than models that combined Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8. In general, detection of selective logging was high with both optical only and optical-SAR combined models, but our results show that the optical data was dominating the predictive performance and adding SAR data introduced noise, lowering the detection of selective logging. While we have shown limited capabilities with C-band SAR, the anticipated opening of the ALOS-PALSAR archives and the anticipated launch of NISAR and BIOMASS in 2023 should stimulate research investigating similar methods to understand if longer wavelength SAR might improve classification of areas affected by selective logging when combined with optical data.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 by the authors.},

Long-term time series of remote sensing-based vegetation indices and their influencing environmental driving factors, such as human activities and climate change, have been widely discussed in the literature. Globally, however, little is known about the hydroclimatic processes controlling vegetation changes in mountainous regions, which are conceived as more sensitive to climate change than other landscapes. The present study aims to quantify the respective roles of two dominant hydroclimatic factors, namely, TWS (i.e., terrestrial water storage) and T<inf>air</inf> (i.e., temperature), in the spatio-temporal changes of mountainous vegetation over global six contrasting climate zones (i.e., tropical, arid, subtropical, temperate, sub-frigid, and frigid zones) during the period 2003&ndash;2016 based on EVI (i.e., enhanced vegetation index), TWS, T<inf>air</inf>, and elevation data. Results indicate that the mean EVI shows a larger increasing trend (+0.85 %/decade, p-value &lt; 0.01) and a larger decreasing trend in TWS (&minus;85 mm/decade, p-value &lt; 0.01) across the global mountainous regions than other global regions combined together (+0.61 %/decade, p-value &lt; 0.01), particularly over high latitudes. With the increasing latitudes, the positive effect of temperature more dominates mountainous vegetation growth than moisture, as evidenced by the increasing trends of EVI with warming. However, in certain low-latitude mountainous regions (e.g., East Africa, South Asia, the western Tibetan Plateau, Brazil Plateau, and the southern Rocky Mountains), mountainous vegetation may face degradation due to water deficit induced by increased snowmelt, especially among the high-elevation ecosystems. The water availability controls vegetation activities more than T<inf>air</inf> in the mid- and low-latitude regions, including the tropical, arid, and subtropical climate zones. These findings indicate that the potential shifts in mountainous vegetation may occur under the notable interactions with hydroclimatic factors, as the high-latitudes are experiencing ongoing warming and the mid- and low-latitudes are getting dryer.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {With the deepening research of global change, it is increasingly recognized that at the regional scale, changes in land use/land cover caused by human activities such as deforestation, urban expansion, and farmland reclamation affected the land surface characteristics and thus play a dominant factor in land surface radiative budget and energy balance, which is a key link in understanding the impact of human activities on global climate change. Based on the 30 m Globe Land 30 dataset and 1000 m MODIS albedo products, this study quantitatively analyzed the spatial variations of surface albedo at interannual and seasonal scales, and compared its characteristics between farmland, forest, grassland and artificial surfaces in different climate zones among China, the United States, India, and Brazil. Then the changes in albedo due to reclamation and urbanization were further simulated. Results show that (1) the interannual surface albedo from 2000 to 2015 showed a slight decline in India and a weak increase in Brazil, which had a obvious spatial heterogeneity in China and the United States. The arid and semi-arid zones in China and humid zones in middle and low latitudes of the United States showed decline trends, however the humid subtropical zones in China and the microthermal as well as the arid zones in the United States were opposite. (2) Under the snow-free condition, the interannual surface albedo of the farmland, forest, grassland and artificial surfaces have country differences. The surface albedo of the four types were high in summer and low in winter, and were obviously higher in arid and semi-arid zones than in humid zones. The albedo of humid subtropical zones in China has increased which is contrary to the arid and semiarid zones. Except for the farmland in arid zones in the United States that showed a relatively strong interannual trend, others generally declined. All types have decreased in India, however raised in Brazil. (3) Compared to the snow-free condition, when under the snow condition, the surface albedo of the four land cover types have raised. The albedo changes in forest are 0.06 to 0.26, which is the smallest, and 0.17 to 0.38 in cultivated land, which is the highest. And the albedo changes of forest in China is higher than that in the United States. (4) Reclamation and urbanization on forest will increase the albedo in all months, which will be more aggravated in arid zones than in humid zones. Reclamation on grassland will increase the albedo in India, Brazil, humid subtropical zones in China, and the United States. But the changes due to urbanization further demonstrate the variations between countries and zones that impacted by the original land cover types, seasons and background climate. Therefore, even under the same climatic background, the variation of surface albedo has different directions and magnitudes in different countries. The spatial heterogeneity of albedo changes can reflect the differences in natural geographic background and can also reflect the differentiation in human disturbances such as different land use patterns and eco-environment policies which may helps the further analysis and understanding of the driving mechanism of the impacts on land surface characteristics caused by land use/land cover changes.<br/> &copy; 2020, Science Press.

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">In tropical savannas, one of the most fire-prone biomes on Earth, fire management is a continuous and iterative process that can only be effectively achieved with thorough consideration of fire regimes. Based on remotely sensed imagery and in-situfield data, key fire regime components were assessed for tropical savannas of northern Australia (frequency, patchiness, intensity, and severity) and Brazil (frequency). The discrete lognormal model was found to be the best method for modelling fire frequency in tropical savannas, and demonstrated that fire frequency is very high in both countries. In northern Australia, fire patchiness was lower in the late dry season, characterized by shorter and fewer unburned patches, than in the early dry season. Fire intensity and severity were highest in the late dry season. The observed temporal differences are consistent with the hypothesis that climate is the main driver of fire regime seasonality. Fuel load and fuel continuity explained fire regime differences between vegetation types. Fire season was bimodal, with peaks in May and October, related to periods of anthropogenic fire and optimal fire weather conditions. Prescribed burning in the early dry season can increase the patchiness and reduce the intensity of late dry season fires, with substantial benefits for biodiversity and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

abstract = {Human-induced tropical deforestation and forest degradation are widely recognized as major environmental threats, negatively affecting tropical forest ecosystem services, such as biodiversity and climate regulation. To mitigate the effects of forest disturbance, particularly carbon emissions, national forest monitoring systems are being established throughout the tropics. Multiple good practice guidelines aimed at developing accurate, compatible and cost-effective monitoring systems have been issued by IPCC, UNFCCC, GFOI and other organizations. However, there is a lack of consensus in characterization of the baseline state of the forests and carbon stocks. This dissertation is focused on the improvement of the current methods of remotely-sensed forest area and carbon loss estimation. A sample-based estimation method employing Landsat-based forest type and change maps and GLAS Lidar-modeled carbon data was first prototyped for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and then applied for the entire pan-tropical region. The DRC study found that Landsat-scale (30m) map-based forest loss assessments unadjusted for errors may lead to significant underestimation of forest aboveground carbon (AGC) loss in the environments with small-scale land cover change dynamics. This conclusion was supported by the pan-tropical study, which revealed that Landsat-based mapping omitted almost half (44%) of forest loss in Africa compared to the sample-based estimate (sample-based estimate exceeded map-based by 78%). Landsat performed well in Latin America and Southeast Asia (sample-based estimate exceeded map-based by 15% and 6% respectively), where forest dynamics are dominated by large-scale industrial forest clearings. The pan-tropical validation sample also allowed disaggregating forest cover and AGC loss by occurrence in natural- (primary and mature secondary forests, and natural woodlands) or human-managed (tree plantations, agroforestry systems, areas of subsistence agriculture with rapid tree cover rotation) forests. Pan-tropically, 58% of AGC loss came from natural forests, with proportion of natural AGC loss being the highest in Brazil (72%) and the lowest in the humid tropical Africa outside of the DRC (22%). The pan-tropical study employed a novel forest stratification for carbon estimation based on forest structural characteristics (canopy cover and height) and intactness, which aided in reducing standard errors of the sample-based estimate (SE of 4% for the pan-tropical gross forest loss area estimate). Such a stratification also allowed for the quantification of forest degradation by delineating intact and non-intact forest areas with different carbon content. This indirect approach to quantify forest degradation was advanced in the last research chapter by automating the process of intact (hinterland) forest mapping. Hinterland forests are defined as forest patches absent of and removed from disturbance in near-term history. Their utility in using spatial context to map structurally different (degraded and non-degraded) forests points a way forward for improved stratification of forest carbon stocks. Conclusions from the dissertation summarize strengths and challenges of sample-based area estimation in monitoring forest carbon stocks and the possible use of such estimates in the revision of spatially explicit maps by adjusting them to match the unbiased sample-based estimates. Hinterland forest maps, in addition to providing a valuable stratum for sample-based carbon monitoring, may serve as a baseline for the near real-time monitoring of remaining ecologically intact tropical forests.

abstract = {Forest cover loss in the tropics is well known to cause warming at deforested sites, with maximum temperatures being particularly sensitive. Forest loss causes warming by altering local energy balance and surface roughness, local changes that can propagate across a wide range of spatial scales. Consequently, temperature increases result from not only changes in forest cover at a site, but also by the aggregate effects of non-local forest loss. We explored such non-local warming within Brazil's Amazon and Cerrado biomes, the region with the world's single largest amount of forest loss since 2000. Two datasets, one consisting of in-situ air temperature observations and a second, larger dataset consisting of ATs derived from remotely-sensed observations of land surface temperature, were used to quantify changes in maximum temperature due to forest cover loss at varying length-scales. We considered undisturbed forest locations (1 km<sup>2</sup> in extent), and forest loss trends in annuli ('halos'), located 1-2 km, 2-4 km, 4-10 km and 10-50 km from these undisturbed sites. Our research finds significant and substantial non-local warming, suggesting that historical estimates of warming due to forest cover loss under-estimate warming or mis-attribute warming to local change, where non-local changes also influence the pattern of temperature warming.<br/> &copy; 2019 The Author(s).

This study evaluated the effect of contrasting stockings of Gmelina arborea on its initial growth and aboveground Carbon stock, and the efficacy of aerial images obtained using drones to capture the crown cover at different stockings. The results indicated that denser stockings showed greater tree heights and stem diameter increments, contrary to traditional measurements. The C storage capacity of Gmelina arborea was promising, with an aboveground estimated C stock of about 13 Mg ha<sup>&minus;1</sup> in 9 months, making it a valuable and promising species for CO<inf>2</inf> sequestration under the context of climate change. The use of simple Red-Green-Blue (RGB) cameras and drones to detect and estimate crown areas in young plantations was mainly viable within the commercial range of stockings (500&ndash;2000 trees ha<sup>&minus;1</sup>), and can be used as a powerful tool to better understand tree initial growth. The results showed effective discrimination without weeds independently of the stocking level; however, when weeds were present, the effectiveness decreased.

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">For monitoring and reporting forest carbon stocks and fluxes, many countries in the tropics and subtropics rely on default values of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventories. Default IPCC forest AGB values originated from 2006, and are relatively crude estimates of average values per continent and ecological zone. The 2006 default values were based on limited plot data available at the time, methods for their derivation were not fully clear, and no distinction between successional stages was made. As part of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for GHG Inventories, we updated the default AGB values for tropical and subtropical forests based on AGB data from &gt;25 000 plots in natural forests and a global AGB map where no plot data were available. We calculated refined AGB default values per continent, ecological zone, and successional stage, and provided a measure of uncertainty. AGB in tropical and subtropical forests varies by an order of magnitude across continents, ecological zones, and successional stage. Our refined default values generally reflect the climatic gradients in the tropics, with more AGB in wetter areas. AGB is generally higher in old-growth than in secondary forests, and higher in older secondary (regrowth &gt;20 years old and degraded/logged forests) than in young secondary forests (20 years old). While refined default values for tropical old-growth forest are largely similar to the previous 2006 default values, the new default values are 4.0-7.7-fold lower for young secondary forests. Thus, the refined values will strongly alter estimated carbon stocks and fluxes, and emphasize the critical importance of old-growth forest conservation. We provide a reproducible approach to facilitate future refinements and encourage targeted efforts to establish permanent plots in areas with data gaps.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 The Author(s).

abstract = {One third of contemporary tropical forests is designated by national forest services for timber production. Tropical forests are also increasingly affected by anthropogenic disturbances. However, there is still much uncertainty around the capacity of tropical forests to recover their timber volume after logging as well as other disturbances such as fires, large blow-downs and extreme droughts, and thus on the long-term sustainability of logging. We developed an original Bayesian hierarchical model of Volume Dynamics with Differential Equations (VDDE) to infer the dynamic of timber volumes as the result of two ecosystem processes: volume gains from tree growth and volume losses from tree mortality. Both processes are expressed as explicit functions of the forest maturity, i.e. the overall successional stage of the forest that primarily depends on the frequency and severity of the disturbances that the forest has undergone. As a case study, the VDDE model was calibrated with data from Paracou, a long-term disturbance experiment in a neotropical forest where over 56 ha of permanent forest plots were logged with different intensities and censused for 31 years. With this model, we could predict timber recovery at Paracou at the end of a cutting cycle depending on the logging intensity, the rotation cycle length, and the proportion of commercial volume. The VDDE modelling framework developed presents three main advantages: (i) it can be calibrated with large tree inventories which are widely available from national forest inventories or logging concession management plans and are easy to measure, both on the field and with remote sensing; (ii) it depends on only a few input parameters, which can be an advantage in tropical regions where data availability is scarce; (iii) the modelling framework is flexible enough to explicitly include the effect of other types of disturbances (both natural and anthropogenic: e.g. blow-downs, fires and climate change) on the forest maturity, and thus to predict future timber provision in the tropics in a context of global changes.<br/> &copy; 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Situated in the central Congo Basin, the Cuvette Centrale is the largest tropical peatland complex. However, our knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations in its water levels is limited. By addressing this gap, we can quantify the relationship between the Cuvette Centrale&rsquo;s water levels and greenhouse gas emissions, and further provide a baseline from which deviations caused by climate or land-use change can be observed, and their impacts understood. We present here a novel approach that combines satellite-derived rainfall, evapotranspiration and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate spatial and temporal changes in water level across a sub-region of the Cuvette Centrale. Our key outputs are a map showing the spatial distribution of rainfed and flood-prone locations and a daily, 100 m resolution map of peatland water levels. This map is validated using satellite altimetry data and in situ water table data from water loggers. We determine that 50% of peatlands within our study area are largely rainfed, and a further 22.5% are somewhat rainfed, receiving hydrological input mostly from rainfall (directly and via surface/sub-surface inputs in sloped areas). The remaining 27.5% of peatlands are mainly situated in riverine floodplain areas to the east of the Congo River and between the Ubangui and Congo rivers. The mean amplitude of the water level across our study area and over a 20-month period is 22.8 &plusmn; 10.1 cm to 1 standard deviation. Maximum temporal variations in water levels occur in the riverine floodplain areas and in the inter-fluvial region between the Ubangui and Congo rivers. Our results show that spatial and temporal changes in water levels can be successfully mapped over tropical peatlands using the pattern of net water input (rainfall minus evapotranspiration, not accounting for run-off) and L-band SAR data.<br/></div> &copy; 2023 by the authors.},

abstract = {Wetlands provide valuable ecosystem services and play a central role in global carbon cycling. Changes in rainfall and the flood-pulse are likely to disrupt the processes that maintain these landscapes; further, landscape modification may dramatically alter wetlands and promote terrestrialization. The Pantanal, South America, is the world's largest wetland due to flooding along the Upper Paraguay River. Predicting how water resources in the Pantanal may change is problematic due to a complex drainage network, resulting in the out-of-phase timing of rainfall and the flood pulse. We use remote sensing data of vegetation and climate to better understand the relationships among the rains, the flood pulse, and vegetation. Although rainfall is regionally synchronous, vegetation responses differ based on position relative to inundated areas. Away from rivers, vegetation greening occurs immediately following rainfall. Along channels, greening may lag rainfall by six months, responding closely to local flood stage. Interannual rainfall variability also impacts vegetation differently near flooded areas, with weaker, lagged responses to rainfall due to local water storage. This work suggests that the importance of flood pulse timing for vegetation productivity in inundated areas means that local conditions in wetlands may be the strongest controls on biogeochemical processes.<br/> &copy; 2019 The Author(s).

abstract = {Monitoring forest-agriculture mosaics is crucial for understanding landscape heterogeneity and managing biodiversity. Mapping these mosaics from remotely sensed imagery remains challenging, since ecological gradients from forested to agricultural areas make characterizing vegetation more difficult. The recent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S-2) time series provide a great opportunity to monitor forest-agriculture mosaics due to their high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, while a few studies have used the temporal resolution of S-2 time series alone to map land cover and land use in cropland and/or forested areas, S-1 time series have not yet been investigated alone for this purpose. The combined use of S-1 & S-2 time series has been assessed for only one or a few land cover classes. In this study, we assessed the potential of S-1 data alone, S-2 data alone, and their combined use for mapping forest-agriculture mosaics over two study areas: a temperate mountainous landscape in the Cantabrian Range (Spain) and a tropical forested landscape in Paragominas (Brazil). Satellite images were classified using an incremental procedure based on an importance rank of the input features. The classifications obtained with S-2 data alone (mean kappa index = 0.59-0.83) were more accurate than those obtained with S-1 data alone (mean kappa index = 0.28-0.72). Accuracy increased when combining S-1 and 2 data (mean kappa index = 0.55-0.85). The method enables defining the number and type of features that discriminate land cover classes in an optimal manner according to the type of landscape considered. The best configuration for the Spanish and Brazilian study areas included 5 and 10 features, respectively, for S-2 data alone and 10 and 20 features, respectively, for S-1 data alone. Short-wave infrared and VV and VH polarizations were key features of S-2 and S-1 data, respectively. In addition, the method enables defining key periods that discriminate land cover classes according to the type of images used. For example, in the Cantabrian Range, winter and summer were key for S-2 time series, while spring and winter were key for S-1 time series.<br/> &copy; 2019 by the authors.},

This characterization can be now provided by the novel Earth Observation tools. This study aims to contribute to understanding the innovation in forest and ecological research that can be brought in by advanced remote sensing instruments, and proposes the guild mapping approach as a tool to efficiently monitor the varied tropical forest resources. We evaluated, in tropical Ghanaian forests, the ability of airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral Sentinel-2 data, and derived vegetation indices and textures, to: distinguish between two different forest types; to discriminate among selected dominant species; and to separate trees species grouped according to their functional guilds: Pioneer, Non Pioneer Light Demanding, and Shade Bearer. We then produced guild classification maps for each area using hyperspectral data. Our results showed that with both hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 data these discrimination tasks can be successfully accomplished. Results also stressed the importance of texture features, especially if using the lower spectral and spatial Sentinel-2 resolution data, and highlighted the important role of the new Sentinel-2 data for ecological monitoring. Classification results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall accuracy using Support Vector Machine, over Maximum Likelihood approach. We proposed the functional guilds mapping as an innovative approach to: (i) monitor compositional changes, especially with respect to the effects of global climate change on forests, and particularly in the tropical biome where the occurrence of hundreds of species prevents mapping activities at species level; (ii) support large-scale forest inventories.

Leaf production in the tropics is mainly constrained by water and light availability. Identifying the factors regulating leaf phenology patterns allows efficiently forecasting of climate change impacts. We conducted a novel phenological monitoring study across four Neotropical vegetation sites using leaf phenology time series obtained from digital repeated photographs (phenocameras). Seasonality differed among sites, from very seasonally dry climate in the caatinga dry scrubland with an eight-month long dry season to the less restrictive Cerrado vegetation with a six-month dry season. To unravel the main drivers of leaf phenology and understand how they influence seasonal dynamics (represented by the green color channel (Gcc) vegetation index), we applied Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) to estimate the growing seasons, using water deficit and day length as covariates. Our results indicated that plant-water relationships are more important in the caatinga, while light (measured as day-length) was more relevant in explaining leafing patterns in Cerrado communities. Leafing behaviors and predictor-response relationships (distinct smooth functions) were more variable at the less seasonal Cerrado sites, suggesting that different life-forms (grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees) are capable of overcoming drought through specific phenological strategies and associated functional traits, such as deep root systems in trees.<br/> &copy; 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Modifications of human land use and climate change are known to be a threat for the health and proper functioning of tropical wetlands. They interfere with the seasonal flood pulse, which is seen as the most important driver for biodiversity and directly controls evaporation. In order to investigate the impact of local and upstream changes on wetlands, a regional assessment of evaporation is crucial but challenging in such often remote and poorly gauged ecosystems. Evaporation is the major water balance component of these wetlands and links the flood pulse with the ecosystem. It can therefore be seen as a proxy for their functioning. In the last decades, information from space became an important data source to assess remote wetland areas. Here, we developed a new approach to quantify regional evaporation driven by inundation dynamics as its dominant control. We used three water and vegetation indices (mNDWI (modified Normalized Difference Water Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance products to assess regional inundation dynamics between the dry and wet seasons. Two years of continual in situ water level measurements at different locations in our study area, the Pantanal wetland of South America, provided the reference to evaluate our method. With process-based modeling that used the inundation dynamics to determine the water available for evaporation, we were able to estimate actual evaporation (AET) on a regional scale. Relating AET to changes in discharge due to upstream flow modifications and on local precipitation over the last 13 years, we found that the Pantanal is more vulnerable to alternated inundation dynamics than to changes in local precipitation. We concluded that coupling ground-and space-based information in this remote wetland area is a valuable first step to investigate the status of the Pantanal ecosystem.<br/> &copy; 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Reducing global forest losses is essential to mitigate climate change and its associated social costs. Multiple market and non-market factors can enhance or reduce forest loss. Here, to understand the role of non-market factors (for example, policies, climate anomalies or conflicts), we can compare observed trends to a reference (expected) scenario that excludes non-market factors. We define an expected scenario by simulating land-use decisions solely driven by market prices, productivities and presumably plausible decision-making. The land-use allocation model considers economic profits and uncertainties as incentives for forest conversion. We compare reference forest losses in Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia (2000&ndash;2019) with observed forest losses and assign differences from non-market factors. Our results suggest that non-market factors temporarily lead to lower-than-expected forest losses summing to 11.1 million hectares, but also to phases with higher-than-expected forest losses of 11.3 million hectares. Phases with lower-than-expected forest losses occurred earlier than those with higher-than-expected forest losses. The damages avoided by delaying emissions that would otherwise have occurred represent a social value of US$61.6 billion (as of the year 2000). This result shows the economic importance of forest conservation efforts in the tropics, even if reduced forest loss might be temporary and reverse over time.<br/></div> &copy; 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Natural wetlands are the largest source of methane emissions, contributing 20&ndash;40% of global emissions and dominating the inter-annual variability. Large uncertainties remain on their variability and response to climate change. This study uses atmospheric methane observations from the GOSAT satellite to evaluate methane wetland emission estimates. We assess how well simulations reproduce the observed methane inter-annual variability by evaluating the detrended seasonal cycle. The latitudinal means agree well but maximum differences in the tropics of 28.1&ndash;34.8 ppb suggest that all simulations fail to capture the extent of the tropical wetland seasonal cycle. We focus further analysis on the major natural wetlands in South America: the seasonally flooded savannah of the Pantanal (Brazil) and Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia) regions; and the riverine wetlands formed by the Paran&aacute; River (Argentina). We see large discrepancies between simulation and observation over the Pantanal and Llanos de Moxos region in 2010, 2011 and 2014 and over the Paran&aacute; River region in 2010 and 2014. We find highly consistent behaviour between the time and location of these methane anomalies and the change in wetland extent, driven by precipitation related to El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation activity. We conclude that the inability of land surface models to increase wetland extent through overbank inundation is the primary cause of these observed discrepancies and can lead to under-estimation of methane fluxes by as much as 50% (5.3&ndash;11.8 Tg yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>) of the observed emissions for the combined Pantanal and Paran&aacute; regions. As the hydrology of these regions is heavily linked to ENSO variability, being able to reproduce changes in wetland behaviour is important for successfully predicting their methane emissions.<br/> &copy; 2018 The Authors},

abstract = {Selective logging and forest fires have increased at a rapid pace in tropical regions in recent decades. Forest disturbances caused by selective logging and forest fires may vary in scale, ranging from local damage to forest canopy, habitats, soils, and biodiversity, to global changes caused by logging-related release of carbon into the atmosphere. This study provides a regional assessment of forest impacts by selective logging and forest fires for 1992, 1996, and 1999. Multivariate statistical models, remote sensing approaches, Geographic Information System (GIS), and remotely sensed imagery combined with field data were applied to verify the scale of environmental changes associated with these processes of forest disturbance. In this regard, the study widens the current knowledge on land use and land cover classifications to include selectively logged and burned forests as additional thematic classes. These classes have not yet been properly accounted for by conventional remote sensing approaches of deforestation assessment, despite their relevance for the understanding of the changes affecting tropical forests. This study is the first multi-temporal and spatial assessment of the selective logging and forest fire impacts in the Brazilian Amazon. The resulting estimates show that at least 11800 km 2, 16500 km2, and 35600 km2 of natural forests were selectively logged and/or burned by 1992, 1996, and 1999, respectively. More than 60% of these forest disturbances observed in the Brazilian Amazon during those years were due to selective logging activities. However, forest fires were responsible for the greatest impacts on natural forests, causing an estimated loss of 18.8% of forest canopy in the study region. I also estimated that approximately 5467 km2, 7618 km2, and 17437 km2 were active areas of selective logging and/or forest fires in 1992, 1996, and 1999, respectively. In addition, approximately 4% of total forest disturbed by selective logging and forest fires was geographically located within protected areas. Areas affected by selective logging and forest fire corresponded to 2.7%, 3.2%, and 6.3% of total deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon by 1992, 1996, and 1999, respectively. Altogether, the present study demonstrated not only the importance of the selective logging and forest fires as important drivers of forest change in the tropics, but improved the existing knowledge of their combined impacts in forested lands in the Brazilian Amazon. Furthermore, the results of this research are expected to support and enhance the scope of global climate change studies associated with environmental changes caused by economic activities based on the exploitation of natural resources available in tropical forests. In terms of its applications to normative efforts, this study could be used to enlighten authorities and staff of environmental agencies working to develop sustainable management programs and environmental policies in Brazil and other tropical countries.

abstract = {Degraded tropical forests dominate agricultural frontiers and their management is becoming an urgent priority. This calls for a better understanding of the different forest cover states and cost-efficient techniques to quantify the impact of degradation on forest structure. Canopy texture analyses based on Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) optical imagery provide proxies to assess forest structures but the mechanisms linking them with degradation have rarely been investigated. To address this gap, we used a lightweight Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to map 739 ha of degraded forests and acquire both canopy VHSR images and height model. Thirty-three years of degradation history from Landsat archives allowed us to sample 40 plots in undisturbed, logged, over-logged and burned and regrowth forests in tropical forested landscapes (Paragominas, Par&aacute;, Brazil). Fourier (FOTO) and lacunarity textures were used to assess forest canopy structure and to build a typology linking degradation history and current states. Texture metrics capture canopy grain, heterogeneity and openness gradients and correlate with forest structure variability (R2 = 0.58). Similar structures share common degradation history and can be discriminated on the basis of canopy texture alone (accuracy = 55%). Over-logging causes a lowering in forest height, which brings homogeneous textures and of finer grain. We identified the major changes in structures due to fire following logging which changes heterogeneous and intermediate grain into coarse textures. Our findings highlight the potential of canopy texture metrics to characterize degraded forests and thus be used as indicators for forest management and degradation mitigation. Inexpensive and agile UAV open promising perspectives at the interface between field inventory and satellite characterization of forest structure using texture metrics.<br/> &copy; 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Their clearing, burning, draining, and harvesting can make slopes dangerously unstable, degrade water resources, change local climate, or release to the atmosphere the organic carbon (C) that they store in their biomass and soils as greenhouse gases (GHGs). These forest disturbances accounted for 19% or more of annual human-caused emissions of CO<inf>2</inf> to the atmosphere from the years 2000 to 2010, and that level is more than the global transportation sector, which accounted for 14% of these emissions. Forest regrowth from disturbances removes about half of the CO<inf>2</inf> emissions coming from the forest disturbances (Houghton, 2013; IPCC 2014).

abstract = {The need for accurate estimates of forest cover and forest fragmentation is a critical issue for developing countries such as Costa Rica. Accurate estimates of forest cover can help in several sectors related to the environment and economic development. This dissertation focuses on providing an accurate and precise estimate of forest cover in Costa Rica. The year 1991 was used as a baseline. Landsat Thematic Mapper was the remote sensing sensor used in this analysis. This dissertation concludes that: (1) Twenty-nine percent (&sim;1,400,000 ha) of the country was under primary forest (80% canopy closure) in 1991. Of the total forest cover, 71% is outside national parks and 29% is protected by the national parks. (2) Forest loss (for scene path 15/row 53) during five years period (1986-1991) was 224,970 ha, and it was estimated that the rate was &sim;44,994 ha/yr. (3) Deforestation produced an increase in island fragments during the study period. Between 1986 and 1991, the total number of islands between three and 50 ha, and 50 and 100 ha increased by 524 and 45, respectively. Fifteen new islands with areas greater than 500 ha were created. (4) Results suggest that the extent of tropical deforestation go beyond estimations of total forest loss at the national level. The impacts at the national level have greater roots deeper roots when the data at the life zone level is considered. The results have important implication for biodiversity conservation and restoration, water resource management and climate change. The issue of partial sampling of remote sensing data base was also explored through this dissertation. Partial sampling is important for the definition of sound deforestation monitoring systems in tropical environments. A data set from the Brazilian Amazon was analyzed in order to understand how stratified sampling, using persistence, would improve estimates of tropical deforestation over random sampling. Results show that stratification based on persistence contributes to the reduction of error, regarding estimates of total deforestation, when contrasted against random sampling without stratification (FAO methodology). Results are important to future monitoring programs in Costa Rica and the Central American region.
